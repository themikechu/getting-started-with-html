    <h1> Notes from the first section</h1>
<b> how the web works</b>
<p>A <b>person</b> uses a <b>computer</b> which communicates with <b>servers</b> using <em>HTTP</em>. From their communication, the <b>server</b> then sends information back to the <b>computer</b>. The <b>web browser</b>is how this is viewed. </p>
<p>We learned how to insert links <a href = www.google.com> like this</a></a>, how to make text <b>bold</b>, how to <em>italicize</em> and  how to insert an image <img src="http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/400/a6/a6408d37-c4b9-43d9-89b2-59b90486909e_400.jpg">     <b></b></p>
<p>We also learned about inline and block elements. Block elements have a "box" around them.</p>
<br>We also learned that if you have an error in your code, you computer does not fix it on it's own. The computer will follow the directions that you give it.
